I went for a walk in the forest🌳This was a Big forest and i was all alone.
Suddenly i see a Big shadow out of nowhere !! I was scared that it would be a scary animal, but i could not see it😮😮 !?
The day before, there was a news report about a dangerous animal in this town, but i was not technically sure if the report was real, because "officially noone had seen anything", so i decided to run🏃‍♀️💨
I ran as fast as possible. Home to my dad and yelled "I think i saw the animal from the report!!!". My dad was confused and asked:"What report?". It was a dream.
